     <h3>WE ARE FSTVL 2020</h3>
     <p>September 12-13, 2020 <br>
      London, UK <br>
      After a standout debut in 2013, the award-winning We Are FESTVL 
      continues to evolve into one of the UK's most popular electronic festivals. 
      Taking place over the May bank holiday weekend, hundreds of international DJs 
      descend upon the aptly named Airfield of Dreams (just east on London) to play 
      on more than 15 custom stages. After five years, they've even been able to add 
      camping to the bill. <br>
      We Are FSTVL is the multi-award winning UK dance music festival - our music 
      speaks volumes and that's why we've grown rapidly, year on year. <br>
      The festival brings together over 80000 ticket holders with the biggest names 
      in electronic and techno dance music, alongside some of the world’s leading club 
      brands and labels, in a remarkable setting at the Airfield of Dreams, Upminster, London. <br>
      Get in touch and be here this year.

     <h3>ION FESTIVAL 2020</h3>
     <p>September 2-9, 2020 <br>
      Dhërmi, Albania <br>
      ION is a different kind of music event, one where you’re invited to get outside the usual festival 
      fences and have a real holiday experience. For everyone who chooses to come with us on this extended 
      summer party, ION will be a week filled with new encounters and 3,000 like-minded friends, all 
      soundtracked by electronic music’s best artists.<br>
      Compared to its neighboring European countries, Albania is relatively unaffected by Coronavirus, 
      however there is still a great deal of uncertainty ahead in terms of travel, quarantine restrictions, 
      and the lifting of the ban on mass gatherings. We’ve left it as late as possible to make this call in 
      the hope that the situation might change, but with the continued uncertainty and risk involved, we 
      needed to finally make a decision.

      Derbyshire, UK <br>
      Bearded Theory is a multi-award winning creative and performing arts festival set in the

      3 counties of West Midlands, South Derbyshire and Staffordshire and only 2 hours away for 50% 
      of the UKs population.<br>
      In 2016 we won “UK`s Best Family Festival” at the UK Festival Awards, 2014 we won “Promoter of the Year” 
      award at the UK Festival Awards and Festival Kidz “Silver Award”. We have been recognized in the National 
      press as being one of the best festivals of the summer in various articles in the Guardian, Express, Sun, 
      Independent, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 1, Channel 4, BBC Entertainment and the Mirror. We have an award-winning 
      free Children’s Village along with an award-winning bar selling real ales, lagers and ciders at pub tariffs. 
      In addition, we are one of the very few festivals that allow you to bring your own drink into our arenas.

     <h3>ELEMENTS LAKEWOOD FESTIVAL 2020</h3>
     <p>September 25-27, 2020 <br>
      Lakewood, PA <br>
      After 10 years of throwing wildly successful ragers in the big city, BangOn!NYC brings their style to the 
      woods for a three-day summer camp-style party. The new Memorial Day Weekend festival features seven stages, 
      massive art installations, and plenty of fun camp games. Grab a cabin or bring a tent to the bucolic hills 
      of Northeastern Pennsylvania and be ready to dance.<br>
      Elements Music & Arts Festival is a dance music festival in Lakewood, Pennsylvania. Spreading a lineup that 
      covers the wide-ranging capabilities of electronic music across three stages, the festival has built a reputation 
      as one of America's best-hidden gems. <br>
      As the name suggests, the festival brings together the essential elements of human life like community, environment, 
      mindfulness, creativity and entertainment into one immersive experience. 2020 will mark Elements Festival's fourth 
      edition, gathering like-minded seekers of a connection to the fundamentals of existence through music, visual arts, 
      and yoga and wellness classes.
