     <h3>E1 Night Club</h3>
     <p>Unit 2, 110 Pennington St, Wapping, London E1W 2BB <br>
      One of the unknown clubs in London, but became very popular last year. 
      Specializes mostly on electronic music, especially Drum and Bass. 
      Powerful sound, amazing atmosphere, popular DJ all of this in one club. <br>
      E1 club located near Tobacco Dock at Studio Spaces. 
      This company has got a lot of different suggestions, for renting the studios for 
      any type of event. For Drum and Bass lovers, there are existing 2 Facebook
      groups, The Drum & Bass Bible and DnB Allstars.

     <h3>PrintWorks</h3>
     <p>Surrey Quays Rd, Rotherhithe, London SE16 7PJ <br>
      Printworks is one of the biggest nightclubs in London, the abandoned and untamed of the Printworks, 
      this is its biggest charm. You can easily get lost in crowd, when it is 2000 people or more. 
      It feels like a futuristic place of worship rather than a factory of a club. Music energy works much 
      better in this kind of space, because the hall is long and narrow. Techno and drum ‘n’ bass have 
      something magic in their sound in this building.<br>
      Unfortunately, now they allowed only to show movies, so it’s working as the cinema. 
      <h3>The nearest date for special events will start only at beginning of 2021. The first release date 
      of special guest in on 12.02.2021 Sub Focus </h3>
